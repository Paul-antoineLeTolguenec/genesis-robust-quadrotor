# ROADMAP — genesis-robust-rl

## How to use this file
At the start of each session, read this file to locate the current milestone.
Update status when starting (`in_progress`) and when done (`completed`).

**Design review rule:** before marking any design doc `[x]`, launch 2–3 parallel review subagents
(see `CLAUDE.md` → "Design Review Protocol"). Resolve all blocking issues first.

## Status legend
- `[ ]` not started
- `[~]` in progress
- `[x]` completed

---

## Phase 0 — Project Setup
- [x] Create GitHub repo
- [x] Clone locally, init CLAUDE.md + ROADMAP.md
- [x] Init Python project (pyproject.toml, UV, src layout)
- [x] Setup CI (GitHub Actions: lint + tests)

## Phase 0.5 — Feasibility Study
- [x] `docs/00_feasibility.md` — Genesis API feasibility verified and documented

## Phase 1 — Design (no code)
- [x] `docs/01_perturbations_catalog.md` — complete perturbation catalog validated (must ref 00_feasibility.md)
- [x] `docs/00b_sensor_models.md` — phenomenological sensor forward models (gyro, accel, mag, baro, GPS, optical flow)
- [x] `docs/02_class_design.md` — class hierarchy validated (includes SensorModel layer)
- [x] `docs/05_test_conventions.md` — mandatory test contract for subagents (unit + integration + perf)
- [x] `docs/03_api_design.md` — Gym + adversarial API validated
- [x] `docs/04_interactions.md` — component interactions validated

## Phase 1.5 — Test Infrastructure (prerequisite for parallel implementation)
> Goal: give each subagent a self-contained test harness so it can autonomously validate its work.
> Each subagent receives: `02_class_design.md` + `05_test_conventions.md` + `06_test_infrastructure.md` + catalog entries for its category.
> A subagent's work is DONE only when all its tests pass (unit + integration + perf).

- [x] `docs/06_test_infrastructure.md` — test infrastructure design validated
- [x] `pytest` + `pytest-cov` configured in `pyproject.toml`
- [x] `tests/conftest.py` — shared fixtures:
  - `mock_env_state(n_envs)` — realistic `EnvState` tensor batch
  - `mock_scene()` — Genesis scene stub with patched setters
  - `assert_lipschitz(perturbation, n_steps)` — helper to verify Lipschitz over a trajectory
- [x] Placeholder test passing in CI (`tests/test_placeholder.py`)

## Phase 2 — Perturbation Engine (parallelizable by category)
> **Prerequisite (sequential):** implement `base.py` first — all parallel categories depend on it.
>
> **Pipeline per category (5 phases):**
> 1. **Implement** (`/implement-category N`) — code + tests + doc + plots (sequential per perturbation)
> 2. **Review** (3 agents //) — correctness, code quality, perf patterns → fix BLOCKING issues
> 3. **Measure** — P6 overhead test with real Genesis CF2X → overhead report
> 4. **Optimize** (`/judge-category N`) — propose optimizations for perturbations >100% overhead
> 5. **Judge** — synthesis report → user decides which optimizations to apply
>
> Phases 1–3 are autonomous. Phases 4–5 require user decisions.
> A category is DONE when: all tests pass, all BLOCKING fixed, all ❌FAIL optimized under 200%.

## Current milestone
**Phase 3 — Base Gym Environment** — COMPLETED

**Phase 3 summary:**
- `PerturbationConfig`, `SensorConfig`, `DesyncConfig` — config dataclasses with validation
- `RobustDroneEnv(gym.Env)` — abstract base, Gymnasium-compatible
  - reset() [1]-[7], step() [0]-[11] — conformes à `04_interactions.md`
  - 4 hooks: physics, motor, sensor, action
  - Variable delta_t (3.5 substeps jitter) + desync (3.6 correlated obs/action delay)
  - Privileged obs, mode switch DR/ADV, curriculum scale, set_perturbation_values, update_params
  - `policy_to_rpm()` and `_compute_reward()` are `@abstractmethod` stubs
- 3 review agents: 2 BLOCKING fixed (non-scalar nominal, hardcoded action_dim), 3 HIGH WARNING fixed (cached all_perturbations, mode check, frozen DesyncConfig)
- 101 tests passed, 0 regressions (3075 total suite)

**Phase 2 COMPLETED** — 69 perturbations, 8 categories, all P6 < 200%. Registry auto-doc deferred to Phase 6.

**Immediate next action:** Phase 4 — AdversarialEnv wrapper.

**Key design constraints to respect:**
- `MotorCommandPerturbation` inherits from `Perturbation` (not `PhysicsPerturbation`)
- Physics perturbations called at step [6] post_physics¹ — see `01_perturbations_catalog.md` §Category 1 note
- `OUProcess.step()` must use torch ops only (no numpy)
- `DelayBuffer` uses circular `Tensor[n_envs, max_delay, dim]` — no Python deque
- `tick(is_reset, env_ids=None)` — env_ids is optional (None = all envs)
